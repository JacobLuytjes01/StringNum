This code was made for people who want numbers of near-infinite precision without some of the flaws of floating point.
This code works for positive numbers, and the negative numbers code will work whenever I feel like it.


What currently exists:

Addition

Subtraction

All relational operators (will return bool)


What will be added:

Fully working negative numbers

Subtraction into negative numbers when the numbers have different sizes.

Maybe multiplication
